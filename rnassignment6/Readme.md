# Cart Management App

## Description

In this React Native assignment, I developed a mobile application focused on cart management functionality. The goal was to create an app that allows users to view a list of available products, add products to their cart, remove products from their cart, and persist the cart data locally on the device.

I began by carefully recreating the provided UI mockup, utilizing various React Native components to build the necessary UI elements for the `HomeScreen` and `CartScreen`. The `HomeScreen` displayed the list of available products, while the `CartScreen` showcased the items currently in the user's cart.

## Features

- **View Products**: Users can view a list of available products on the `HomeScreen`.
- **Add to Cart**: Each product on the `HomeScreen` has an "Add to Cart" button.
- **Remove from Cart**: Each item on the `CartScreen` includes a "Remove from Cart" button.
- **Persistent Storage**: Cart data is saved locally on the device using the `AsyncStorage` API.
- **Navigation**: Smooth navigation between `HomeScreen` and `CartScreen` using the `react-navigation` library.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for `AsyncStorage` operations to manage data retrieval and storage issues.

## Development Process

1. **UI Mockup**: Recreated the provided UI mockup using React Native components.
2. **HomeScreen**: Displayed a list of available products.
3. **CartScreen**: Showcased the items in the user's cart.
4. **Add/Remove Items**: Implemented functionality to add and remove products from the cart.
5. **Local Storage**: Used `AsyncStorage` to persist cart data locally.
6. **Error Handling**: Incorporated error handling for smooth data operations.
7. **Navigation**: Implemented navigation using the `react-navigation` library.

## Conclusion

This assignment challenged me to apply my React Native knowledge and skills to build a functional cart management application. I enjoyed the process of designing the user interface, implementing the core features, and ensuring the application's robustness through error handling and local data storage. This project has expanded my understanding of React Native and reinforced my ability to create mobile apps that address real-world use cases.
